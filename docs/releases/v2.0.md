# FenixAI v2.0 Release Notes

Release date: December 2025

## Highlights

- Multi-agent orchestration upgrade to LangGraph
- New ReasoningBank memory system
- Multi-provider LLM support: Ollama, MLX, Groq, HuggingFace
- Hardening: default localhost binding, gated demo users, CI secret scanning scaffolding
- Frontend modernization: React + TypeScript + Vite; strict TS settings

## Security & Runtime

- The API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To bind externally, set `ALLOW_EXPOSE_API=true` intentionally.
- Demo users creation is gated by `CREATE_DEMO_USERS`; use `DEFAULT_DEMO_PASSWORD` to control demo passwords.
- Added `SECURITY.md` and `scripts/release_cleanup.sh` for developer security workflows.

## Upgrade notes & Breaking changes

- Default host now avoids `0.0.0.0` unless explicitly allowed.
- Demo users are no longer seeded by default; set `CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true` to recreate them.

## How to run

Follow `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` for local runs and `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` before publishing.
